# KingsmanShop

KingsmanShop is an e-commerce website that has clothing products. There is a cart where you can see added items and edit, add, or remove them.
## Functionality Overview
Below is a comprehensive overview of the functionalities that the website offers:

### Managing Your Cart
Add and Remove Products: The website allows you to easily add products to your shopping cart with just a few clicks. You can also remove items from your cart when you change your mind or no longer wish to purchase them.

Adjust Quantity: In addition to adding and removing items, you have the flexibility to change the quantity of products in your cart. Whether you want one more of your favorite item or need to reduce the quantity, it's a breeze.

Cart Overlay: There is a convenient cart overlay that displays a summary of the items currently in your cart. This allows you to keep track of your selected items without navigating away from your shopping experience.

Product Attributes: When reviewing your cart or cart overlay, you'll find detailed information about each product, including selected size and other relevant attributes. This ensures you have a clear understanding of your choices before proceeding to checkout.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
